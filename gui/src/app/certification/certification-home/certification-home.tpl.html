<h2><i class="fa fa-paper-plane-o"></i> Testing by Criteria Home</h2>
<br>

<p>This area provides test case listings that are organized by and correspond to the ONC certification criteria for health IT. Select the criteria on the menu bar to see the available ETT test cases for that criteria. Note that the listings here are only the tool-based tests--not a comprehensive list of the required tests for each criterion. Please refer to the ONC Health IT Certification Program Test Procedures and Certification Companion Guides link found in the "Documents" section.
